- I have used [[Namecheap]] email forwarding services for a long time. If you host your #DNS there, there’s no extra charge.
- This is fine for very basic usage but if you want to manage very many email aliases or choose to forward to more than one email address per alias it’s not appropriate.
- [Addy](https://addy.io/)
	- Addy is designed for Anonymous Email Forwarding where you’re creating an alias for every service, so not quite what we’re looking for.
	- Starts at $1/month for custom domains and up to 5 email addresses to forward to.
- [Topicbox](https://www.topicbox.com/)
	- This is #[[group email]] rather than just email forwarding. It’s built by [[Fastmail]], but is a separate dedicated service.
	- Groups basically do email forwarding, although Topicbox does a lot more, like search and a web interface for discussing with the group.
	- Pricing starts at $20/month (the Business tier) for being able to use your own domain. Unlimited public and private groups.
- [Forward Email](https://forwardemail.net)
	- Pricing starts at free with using DNS records to store email, and includes custom domains and unlimited aliases
		- $3/month is the Enhanced plan that doesn’t use public DNS records to store aliases and $9/month is the Team plan
	- > Unlike other services, we **do not store logs** (with the exception of [errors](https://forwardemail.net/en/faq#do-you-store-error-logs) and [outbound SMTP](https://forwardemail.net/en/faq#do-you-support-sending-email-with-smtp)) and are **100% open-source**. We're the **only** service that **never stores nor writes to disk**any emails – it's all done in-memory.
	- They also now support sending email programmatically for #[[transactional email]]
- [ImprovMX](https://improvmx.com)
	- Free for 1 custom domain and up to 25 aliases
	  collapsed:: true
		- Premium is $9/month for 100 domains / 100 aliases
