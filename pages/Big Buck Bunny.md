- Big Buck Bunny is a [[Creative Commons]] licensed video produced by the [[Blender]] team, and is often used as example content for working with video
- From Wikipedia:
	- >*Big Buck Bunny* is the first project by the [[Blender Foundation]] to be created by the [[Blender Institute]] , a division of the foundation set up specifically to facilitate the creation of open content films and games.
	  > 
	  > Work began in October 2007. The film was funded by the Blender Foundation, donations from the Blender community, pre-sales of the film's DVD and commercial sponsorship. Both the final product and production data, including animation data, characters and textures are released under the  [[Creative Commons Attribution License]]. It was rendered on Sun Microsystems grid computing facility Sun Grid.
	  > 
	  > As in *Elephants Dream*, Blender developers worked extensively to improve the software in accordance with the needs of the movie team. Improvements were made in hair and fur rendering, the particle system, UV mapping, shading, the render pipeline, constraints, and skinning. Also introduced during the project was approximate ambient occlusion. These features were released to the public with Blender v. 2.46.
