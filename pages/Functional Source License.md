- The Functional Source License (FSL) is a source-available non-compete license that converts to Apache 2.0 or MIT after one year. It is designed for companies that want to make their core products **as Open Source as possible** without jeopardizing their business. FSL provides everything a developer needs to use and learn from your software.
- FSL's immediate predecessor is the  [[Business Source License]]. BUSL's time-based approach is great, but the Additional Use Grant is a serious flaw, because it creates [too much variability](https://blog.adamretter.org.uk/business-source-license-adoption/#how-is-the-bsl-being-used). Each implementation of the BUSL is essentially a new license, so compliance departments have to separately review every case, which greatly slows adoption. FSL is an evolved BUSL that (we hope) has a better chance of catching on.
