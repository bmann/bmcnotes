- I'm going to liberally quote the main bits of this in order to get to the highlighted bit at the bottom
- From the article
	- ## Sublicenses

		- Owners of copyrights and patents can also allow those they license to license others in turn. A license given by someone who also has a license is called a *sublicense*.
		- Remember our running app example. Users need license for my copyright in the original app, as well as your copyright in your new code. Users could get license for each copyright from its owner: you could license your copyright in the app, and I could license mine.
		- Thanks to sublicensing, license for a copyright or patent doesn’t have to come directly from the owner. If I license you to use, copy, and share my copyright in my original app, and also give you permission to sublicense others to do the same, you can license both copyrights in your new version of my app. You can license your copyright because you own your copyright. You can sublicense my copyright in the app because I licensed you to sublicense.
	- ## Cross-Licenses

		- When two owners of intellectual property rights license each other, we call it a *cross-license*.
		- Remember our running app example again. If I license you to use, copy, and share my copyright in my original app, and also give you permission to sublicense others, you can license both copyrights in your new version of my app. However, I can only license my copyright, not yours.
		- If you license me for your copyright, as I license you for mine—if we cross-license our copyrights in your new version of my app—then we can both license all the copyrights in your new version of the app.
	- ## Cross-License Collaboratives
		- Contributor license agreements as we know them today work like the example in [Sublicenses](((64dbf640-6caa-4b34-9241-2e6adb96a1af))). One person or organization, usually a company or foundation, can license all the contributions to the project.
		- ==[[Cross License Collaboratives]] work like the example in [Cross-Licenses](((64dbf640-ecef-4d2b-b47c-f06ba0199fa2))), with a twist. Any contributor can license all the contributions to the project, *but only if contributors vote to allow it as a group*.==
