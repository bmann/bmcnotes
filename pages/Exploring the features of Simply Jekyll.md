Essentiality is the heart of any good software, and this theme is designed to ensure that I don't add things that I won't use on a daily basis or not have things that would be important for my personal usecase. It has been designed carefully to get rid of all  the feature creeps, bloatwares, etc. i.e., no bootstrap, no semantic, no jquery, no nothing...

That said, this is a ready made theme and I am making it public so that more number of people will use it and enjoy the experience of using it. So, pardon my bigotry thereðŸ˜….

As for the list of features, this website steals features from every website that I can think of, or more appropriately the design inspiration for this website is derived from multiple sources; Here is the tiny list for the curious:

- Backlinks:  Roam Research
- Transclusion:  Tiddlywiki
- Sidenote:  Edward Tufte, Gwern Branwen
- Stale Link Highlighting: Tiddlywiki
- Wiki-style links:  Every wiki ever
- Text highlighting:  Roam Research
- Page preview:  Wikipedia
- Context menu:  Google Docs
- Notes:  Andy Matuschak's Evergreen Notes
- Color scheme: Github
- Feed like structure for home page:  Twitter
- Omnisearch box at the top:  Google
- Profile board:  Twitter/Instagram

Now that you know all my secrets let us not waste any more time into further exposing my true nature in its entirety and get started with tour:P
