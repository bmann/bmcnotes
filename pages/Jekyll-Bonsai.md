- > Jekyll-Bonsai is a jekyll theme built for <a class="wiki-link u-url" href="https://jekyll-bonsai.netlify.app/entry/8869af5551/">wiki-blogging</a> and digital gardening. Most of the site’s interlinking is determined by some extended markdown syntax. This shifts more of the tooling used in determining the site’s structure and navigation from the web tools of html, css, javascript, or a front-end framework to plain markdown files. In turn, this lowers the technical barrier to deciding how to structure the pages on one’s site.
