- As part of publishing LogSeq, I'd like to have an RSS feed
- Ideally, one for Journals, and one for everything else
- Given how LogSeq is designed, it's likely that this can be configurable through various filters, but I think those two are a good start
- Typically, an RSS feed has the last 25 items
