- Not open source. Not closed source. The Fair Source License allows everyone to see the source code and makes the software free to use for a limited number of users in your organization. It offers some of the benefits of open source while preserving the ability to charge for the software.

- How Fair Source Works
	- Any individual user can view, download, execute, and modify the code free of charge. Up to a certain number of users from an organization can use the code for free, too. After an organization hits that user limit, it will start paying a licensing fee determined by the software publisher.
- The Fair Source License can be applied to software applications and their source code. It is *not* currently suitable for library or plugin code.
