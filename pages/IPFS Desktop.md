- > **IPFS Desktop bundles an IPFS node, file manager, peer manager, and content explorer into a single, easy-to-use application.**
  >
  > Use IPFS Desktop to get acquainted with IPFS without needing to touch the terminal â€” or, if you're already experienced, use the powerful menubar/taskbar shortcuts alongside the command line to make your IPFS workflow faster.

  > If you already have an IPFS node on your computer, IPFS Desktop will act as a control panel and file browser for that node. If you don't have a node, it'll install one for you. And either way, IPFS Desktop will automatically check for updates.
