- An [implementation checklist](https://github.com/pzingg/fedi/blob/main/IMPLEMENTATION.md) of all the things an #ActivityPub SDK needs. There are 85 of them, which argues for some solid libraries that multiple systems can use.
- [[Fish Shell]] is thinking of #[[Rewrite it in Rust]] in [this PR](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/9512):
	- > * Nobody really likes C++ or CMake, and there's no clear path for getting off old toolchains. Every year the pain will get worse.
	  > * C++ is becoming a legacy language and finding contributors in the future will become difficult, while Rust has an active and growing community.
	  > * Rust is what we need to turn on concurrent function execution.
	  > * Being written in Rust will help fish continue to be perceived as modern and relevant.
