- Switched over to a new branch for [[BMC/Garden]] to try a #LogSeqConversion
	- I think it will be to completely remove #Jekyll?
	- The #TiddlyWiki conversion was overly complicated, and I've stuck with LogSeq for my scratch notes for quite some time
	- I still love my #twgroceries, and want it to be able to be easily published
