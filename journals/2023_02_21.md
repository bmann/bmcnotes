- I was looking to download some videos from #YouTube
	- The [WikiHow for downloading YouTube](https://www.wikihow.com/Download-YouTube-Videos-on-a-Mac) on #MacOS mentions [[VLC Player]] , which no longer seems to work
	- The second option is [[9xBuddy]] which seems sketchy and I had to dodge some porn ads and pop ups but did get a raw video URL that seems to work
