- [[Web app manifests]]
- New to me feature of having #LogSeq notes as files on iOS — Spotlight indexes them!
	- If you do a regular search, the Files section of results will show matching content
	- Here’s an example search for “cloud”
	- ![2022-12-19-21-14-26.jpeg](../assets/2022-12-19-21-14-26.jpeg)
	- Clicking on them brings up the Markdown plain text file
	- Apps can use the [Spotlight API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/spotlight) to customize this directly in their app (and it would be useful for LogSeq to do this), but “just” having files on disk be part of the index automatically is pretty great — [[integration through the file system]] in action

	- This is still very much a run your own server sort of deal
	- What would a serverless version of this look like?
	- And yes, we should do a Fission Web3Storage UCAN endpoint to put media on IPFS
- [[Stock and Flow]] is a piece that [[Robin Sloan]] wrote on Snarkmarket many years ago

	- I’m getting good personal flow with daily Journals, like this typing here
	- Little tidbits and fragments of orphaned page notes don’t quite add up to anything, so my stock builds slowly
