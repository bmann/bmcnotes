- More [[agora]] thoughts: what about pulling in openly licensed general purpose Git content?

- For instance, [terms.dev](https://terms.dev) is a repository of software industry terms and definitions. It uses the [[Zola]] engine to build the live site, but the [source is Markdown in git](https://github.com/timf/terms.dev).

- Well, this [@ctbeiser Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/ctbeiser/status/1367879838145540098) will help point me towards lots of other notes to flesh out: 

- > if you were making a syllabus on [[tools for thought]] what would be your key inclusions?
>
>especially interested in ones beyond the “obvious list”:
>- Englebart [[Augmenting Human Intellect]]
>- [[As We May Think]]
>- [[Plans and Situated Action]]
>- [[Inventing on Principle]]
>- [[Mindstorms]]

- The [video by @edelwax](https://www.loom.com/share/3fa7e57ea4834330973813fdf7ce73c4) is pretty moving. 

- [@Dylan_Steck mentioned @edelwax recently](https://twitter.com/Dylan_Steck/status/1367623991704313857) as having coined [[Assisted Introspection]].

- I don’t know how much deep study I’m going to do around these things. I’ve always been more about [[tinkerability]] and trying these things out in practice. And then maybe falling into the weeds of building out tech building blocks and standards and protocols. 
- [[Codex]] [^agoralinks] is one of a number of note taking [[tools for thought]] that I’ve been following on [Twitter @codexeditor](https://twitter.com/codexeditor).

- I hadn’t realized that the [Codex Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/codexeditor) was the main web presence other than the Twitter account. It’s actually great to see so many digital creators getting supported directly to build. 

- [^agoralinks]: Which I’m going to have to figure out how to link to the [[Agora]] node that [@flancian made](https://anagora.org/node/codex). I should probably make an [[Agora FAQ]] page.
