- My hosted [[Ghost]] blog at `bmann.ca` is up for renewal.
	- Looking at [[Railway]] for hosting it
	- They have a [[Railway/Ghost Template]] but it has the same issue as all of the other things that try and host Ghost
	- I don't really _need_ another site, but I'm back to thinking about [[LogSeq/Publishing]] for my own site
	- #Hugo is what the [[LogSeq/Schrödinger Plugin]], so I'm going to try doing that
	- I did do a Ghost install on Railway as a test, including adding records to `mail.bmann.ca` so it's setup to send from there
	- My [private repo for the Ghost source](https://github.com/bmann/bmannca-ghost)
	- I don't really want to be using #S3 either [[Ghost/S3 Storage Adapter]]
	- Hard blocked on a #Yarn #error
		- ```shell
		  error "components/tryghost-adapter-cache-redis-5.40.1.tgz": Tarball is not in network and can not be located in cache
		  ```

- OK, let's look at some #[[Eleventy/Templates]]
	- https://spacebook.app/ - a docbook style site with hierarchical nav, tightly integrated with #Netlify
	- https://pack11ty.dev/ - by [[Nicolas Hoizey]], includes #webmention support
	- OK, that's a lot shorter list than I thought it would be
	- Ideally, one of the things I'd like is a feed aggregator like thing, that I think Eleventy is pretty good at
	- A link blog might be a thing I do --> Github Stars, Twitter Favourites, Mastodon Favourites, etc etc

  collapsed:: true
	- Uninstall #NodeJS installed via [[Homebrew]]
	- ```shell
	  brew uninstall --ignore-dependencies node
	  brew uninstall --force node
	  ```
	- Install [[nvm]]
		- ```shell
		  brew install nvm
		  ```
	- And install node versions as needed, eg `nvm install 16` will install the newest 16.x version
