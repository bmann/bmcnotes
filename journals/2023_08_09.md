- [[DWebYVR/Drop-In]] first event today
	- Posted about the space with some photos https://cosocial.ca/@boris/110860822079172675
	- [[Wesley Finck]] and I immediately started talking about #[[tools for thought]]
		- demo of pdf upload and markup with #LogSeq
			- I drag and dropped this PDF, a brochure about a cool event space in #Istanbul called The Seed:
			- ![INT TECH CONF FISSION 16112023 The Seed.pdf](../assets/INT_TECH_CONF_FISSION_16112023_The_Seed_1691603280205_0.pdf)
		- #LogSeq/Hierarchy is a thing I'm showing [[Wesley Finck]]
		- The [[DWebYVR/Website]] is built on an #Obsidian vault and then rendered and published by [[Quartz]]
	- [[Brooklyn Zelenka]]
	- [[Ian Vanagas]]
		- Oh damn, I just realized that Ian wrote [[Smart Young BC]]:
		- ((64d4595a-24bd-46f9-ae17-dda3dfcd4b60))
	- [[Sal Rahman]] came! He runs the Fediverse Meetup Group, I showed him the [[DWebYVR/Calendar]], and we talked a bit about how to cross promote, and look for some evening event time in the fall
		- We also wandered up to look at the [[Internet Archive Canada]] servers, and how exactly this building came to be
		- We also ranted about #ActivityPub
	- [[David Luecke]], who used to host [[Cowork & Coffee]]
		- ((64d3d3d4-c50c-4820-94ab-fae6ffd4c638))
		- Sounds like David could be interested in being a [[DWebYVR/Drop-In]] host in the future
	- [[Jai Djwa]] came, and we had an AMAZING jam session about #cohousing
		- I'd like to see cohousing be a theme that is part of the wider set of #DWebYVR interests
		- From my point of view, [[pooling capital and collaboration]] is the umbrella that could cover open source, Dweb, mesh networks, cohousing, and tech policy, as part of cross-disciplinary topics that we can bring people together around
		- Jai is working on [[East Van Cohousing]] and he gave me a tour of some of the architectural plans and talked about some of the things planned there, like a built in coworking space
		- We also talked [[Texada Island]], buying low rise apartment buildings like the [[Rose Manor]] that I live in, and more
		- I'm going to intro [[Jacob Sayles]] and [[Katie Davis]] and [[Cascadia Design]], at the very least to advise on [[mesh networking]] for the cohousing, but also the coworking!

	  > As self-hosters we are not going to change the face of the world. ==The other 98% of the general public is going to use hegemonic services: self-hosting is a privilege for those who have the education, time and money to put into it.== We’re only deploying solutions that work for us, individually. ==Hosting services for our relatives puts them at risk of losing their data if something happened to us.==
	  > My recommendation to most people putting services online would be: either do it for yourself *only*, or do it as a team with proper structure and processes. What sounds like an initiative to emancipate people could actually alienate them to you, and that is a huge responsibility.
	  > I believe it’s important to be able to self-host, even if only to prove it’s possible to do without hegemonic services. But we need to figure out how to do decentralise services and data storage for individuals *at scale*. This is not just a technical problem, and while #E2EE is a good starting point it’s not a silver bullet. I will expand in a further post about the role of E2EE, where it falls short, and what I think we should do as a society to improve the situation.
	- Meta: experimenting with copying in the tags directly that the person uses
		- If I paste in their tags, they deep link into their site, which is a different slice of information.
			- [#self-hosting](https://ergaster.org/tags/self-hosting) [#hosting](https://ergaster.org/tags/hosting) [#privacy](https://ergaster.org/tags/privacy) [#surveillance](https://ergaster.org/tags/surveillance)
		- This harkens back to #Agora concepts, and is something that has been discussed in the #Subconscious/Discord -- follow mechanics for terms? subscribing to terms? Or namespacing, where `bmcnotes/selfhosting` might be my local version

- I just edited the #LogSeq `logseq/export.css` to not include the #CSS that completely hides the [[BMC/Local LogSeq Property]] that I use, because it meant that critical stuff like the link attribute on a page isn't included
	- ```css
	  .content .pre-block {display: none}
	  ```
	- Oh look, I have at this point 310 pages with the #link attribute!
