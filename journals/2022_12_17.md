- [[Moving Castles: Modular and Portable Multiplayer Miniverses]]
	- This is an article from August 2021
	- Incredibly dense, I’m still processing links and including linked articles around #[[cozy web]] and #[[dark forest]]
- I actually _sort of_ started #RSS reading again, [[NetNewsWire]] on my phone
	- Mostly “old feeds” and getting rid of high volume stuff
	- Adding a few RSS feeds of Mastodon accounts of people, like [[Simon Wardley]] https://mastodon.online/@swardley.rss
- [First Impressions of Stage Manager on an Ultrawide Display](https://taoofmac.com/space/blog/2022/12/14/1230) - [[Tao of Mac]] [[Rui Carmo]] #iPadOS #[[Stage Manager]]

	  > So thanks, Apple.

	- So, I’ll post links, maybe with a few tags or a comment, and a page for the source
