- [Ari’s Garden Electronic Cookbook App](https://github.com/theiceshelf/arisgarden)
- Open source [[ElmLang]] and [[NodeJS]] app for recipes, with actual helpers in the app to help during cooking. 

- The main site is at https://arisgarden.theiceshelf.com/

- Looking at #recipe formats again because @icidasset was asking what the best apps are. I’ve never found one I like for a variety of reasons. 

- [Paprika Recipe Manager](https://www.paprikaapp.com/) was the one that most people recommended. 

- Google has this [JSON-LD format for structured recipe data](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/recipe). As well as rich search results, it can be used by “assistants” to read out by voice.
