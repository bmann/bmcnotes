	- > I was asked [over on mastodon](https://floss.social/@be/109592689246611263) whether I had any recommendations for studying either the period of computer history post-WW2 (thus "post invention of stored-program digital computers") or even pre-WW2 (thus "all the random stuff we used before then").

- [[Ben Brown]] announces [[Shuttlecraft]] “a social media server for one”
	- > It is very small and lightweight open source app that runs nicely on services like [[Glitch]] , but it has most of what you need to host your own personal social media account.
	  > 
	  > It’s got a microblogging tool, to make posts. You can customize the design with HTML and CSS. You can follow people on Mastodon or other services and interact with posts and send messages. People can follow you on Mastodon, or with RSS. You run it on your own server so you own and operate the data and the code and the whole service. And you can hack the code and make it weirder so that we can all be part of a better, more diverse and more interesting web.
