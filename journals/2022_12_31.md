	- > I was asked [over on mastodon](https://floss.social/@be/109592689246611263) whether I had any recommendations for studying either the period of computer history post-WW2 (thus "post invention of stored-program digital computers") or even pre-WW2 (thus "all the random stuff we used before then").

- [[Ben Brown]] announces [[Shuttlecraft]] “a social media server for one”
	- > It is very small and lightweight open source app that runs nicely on services like [[Glitch]] , but it has most of what you need to host your own personal social media account.
	  > 
	  > It’s got a microblogging tool, to make posts. You can customize the design with HTML and CSS. You can follow people on Mastodon or other services and interact with posts and send messages. People can follow you on Mastodon, or with RSS. You run it on your own server so you own and operate the data and the code and the whole service. And you can hack the code and make it weirder so that we can all be part of a better, more diverse and more interesting web.

- Did a quick hack to _sort of_ archive the 2022 #Jekyll edition of #BMC
	- Went to [[Cloudflare]] where `bmannconsulting.com` DNS is hosted
	- Signed up for their new Web3 service and added an [[Cloudflare/IPFS Gateway]] to `2022.bmannconsulting.com`
	- Looked up https://dnsrecords.io/_dnslink.bmcgarden.fission.app to get the current hash `bafybeiejscnpshaozzsfvzjwydtz65msmghgzmwez53ly7ayfpa7tvjoei`
	- Entered that in for the #IPFS/DNSLink entry
	- Now https://2022.bmannconsulting.com serves up that hash
	- TODO I'll probably build what is currently the main branch of [[BMC/Garden]] with an archive notice, and also a `robots.txt` so it doesn't get (double) indexed #BMC/Backlog
- Mark: 11:11pm as when I loaded up this site running on #fission's #ipfs service #BMC
  collapsed:: true
	- Removed the custom domain and turned off [[Github/Pages]] for the repo
	- Went back to #Cloudflare to attempt to figure out redirects
		- Page Rules? Redirects? Transforms?
		- I first deleted the `logseq.bmannconsulting.com` subdomain, then brought it back and pointed it at `bmcgarden.fission.app`
		- TODO Figure out how to get #Cloudflare to redirect logseq subdomain to root `bmannconsulting.com` #BMC
		- There aren't that many logseq subdomain links in the wild
	- I guess I need to update the [[Colophon]]
		- I even have a 2022 version to link to https://2022.bmannconsulting.com/colophon/
		- Updated!
