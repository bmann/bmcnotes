- I'd like to see if I can get [[Indie Kit]] packaged for #Cloudron
	- For starters, that means following the [[Cloudron/Packaging Tutorial]]
	- I'm following the #NodeJS instructions, but really that means working with #Docker
	- `brew install docker`
		- `docker login` gives me
		- ```
		  WARNING! Your password will be stored unencrypted in ~/.docker/config.json.
		  Configure a credential helper to remove this warning. See
		  https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/#credentials-store
		  ```
		- OK, I'll look at that later
	- Running the one liner `docker build -t username/nodejs-app:1.0.0 .`
		- ```
		  DEPRECATED: The legacy builder is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
		              Install the buildx component to build images with BuildKit:
		              https://docs.docker.com/go/buildx/
		  ```
		- Let's see if brew has this, yep `brew install docker-buildx`
		- With some advice about linking it into ` ~/.docker/cli-plugins`
		- New error: `ERROR: Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?`
		- Ugh. I guess I actually do have to install Docker on this [[Apple/Macbook Air M1 2020]] https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44084846/cannot-connect-to-the-docker-daemon-on-macos
