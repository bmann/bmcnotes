- [[A Tweet Before Dying]] by [[Paul Ford]] in [[Wired]]
- [[Paul Miller]] new elliptic curve cryptography library, via [@paulmillr on Twitter](https://twitter.com/paulmillr/status/1606628502140325888)
	- Announcing [[noble-curves]]: the culmination of work on elliptic curve cryptography.
		- Pkg defines ed25519, ed448, secp256k1, P384, P521, bls12-381, bn254, pasta, stark curves.
		- Edwards, Weierstrass, Montgomery primitives, hash2curve & pairings are also in.

	- [[Pedro Gomez]] in the Twitter thread asks why the new library, some great background from Paul
		- > Supply chain security: no dependencies, or minimal dependency on a package from 1 author. If you use something like elliptic, you're exposing yourself to rogue dep updates
		- > JS, not WASM: js can be audited easily, wasm cannot. You may be executing malware when using wasm lib
		- > Auditability, readability: much easier to read code based on native bigints, instead of something like bn.js
		- > Correctness: thorough testing with wycheproof, and others
