	- Yes it’s a great title and line
	- He seems to be expecting a Twitter competitor to go toe to toe with, and doesn’t believe in protocols
	- Mastodon and mastodon.social not being better integrated or run at scale is a problem of that project — a product issue, for sure
	- This should mostly be seen as the starting gun of an opportunity for many different people to experiment with social network products on top of the #ActivityPub protocol
	- Is RSS - in blogging form or podcast form? - the correct counter example of a protocol that enables lots of different high quality product experiences?

	- Using [[Moa Party]] — gotta see if maybe he can help package for [[piku]] or Docker
	- Using [[MetaText]]
	- Has a massive feature list for an iOS client
	- On #ActivityPub:
		- > It is, sadly, a child of the W3C era, and thus relies entirely too much on lobbing chunks of JSON to and fro via HTTP to various endpoints you discover along the way instead of (say) using persistent connections, binary payloads and a topic structure (but I’m biased here).
		- > The most promising alternative server for me is [[Takahē]], which I’ve [already written about](https://taoofmac.com/space/blog/2022/12/21/0900) and intend to contribute to. Its core design avoids most of the problems with scaling ActivityPub], it has a solid foundation and (although it depends too much on PostgreSQL) it feels like the logical choice for easy to maintain, small-to-mid instances.
		- Points at [[Pleroma]] fork [[Rebased]] for solid server to run
		- [[Soapbox]] as a separate front end
			- Announcement of [Soapbox 3.0 Release](https://soapbox.pub/2022/12/25/releasing-soapbox-3-0/) has lots of details

- Discovered [[LogSeq/Hierarchy]] today
	- Actually pretty convenient to group things around a category instead of having a ton of “NAME foo” and “NAME bar” pages
	- Was initially thinking that maybe Archive or Blog might be useful too, but I don’t like the way this changes the title
	- #screenshot of what the default display is for Hierarchy
