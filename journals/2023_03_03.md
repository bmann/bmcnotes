	- > I’ve been working on a tricky project to move Val.town’s internals to [Deno](https://deno.com/) and adding better isolation between execution and the host environment. Luckily, it feels like we’re in the right place at the right time - there are a lot of new [V8 Isolate](https://dev.to/tomlienard/v8-isolates-are-taking-over-the-world-3h4m)-based JavaScript runtimes coming to the surface, standards emerging for them like [WinterCG](https://wintercg.org/), and frameworks built for them like [Hono](https://hono.dev/) and [Remix](https://remix.run/). The last mile - isolation, code bundling, and communication - is still the wild west, and that’s what I’ve been building.
