- Woo hoo! I am so stoked!
- I now have this site auto-publishing using [[Github Actions for Jekyll]], with a [[Fission/Publish]] Github Action at the end.
	- I used the [nicely commented limjh16/jekyll-action-ts](https://github.com/limjh16/jekyll-action-ts/blob/master/.github/workflows/workflow.yml) and then just added fission publish at the end.
- Main thing I need to do to [complete the rollout of these new journal logs](https://github.com/bmann/bmcgarden/issues/2) — other than pagination — is to truncate long posts and strip HTML from them.
	- For short posts, I should not truncate, and actually render markdown.
	- Probably something like, if the content is bigger than 500 characters, `strip_html` and show 250 chars with a read more link. If less than 500, display the content.
	- For reference, this post is about 480 characters without HTML tags.
