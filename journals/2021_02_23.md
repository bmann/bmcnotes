- Via [Roland](http://rolandtanglao.com/2021/02/23/p1-tom-macwright-one-way-to-represent-things-like-r-dataframe-python-pandas-spreadsheet-cells/), [[Tom MacWright]] wonders if the future of programming is [more common data types](https://macwright.com/2021/02/23/one-way-to-represent-things.html):
  - > What if a simpler programming language had first-class representations of a lot more than strings and arrays?
