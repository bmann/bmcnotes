	- Gordon actual goes on to disagree with this slightly

- [[The miracle of the commons]] I have had open in tab, [[Philipp Krüger]] posted it to #Fission
	- It covers my pet peeve: that [[tragedy of the commons]] doesn’t say that commons don’t work, but rather that they need to be managed
	- ((63bafe44-85ea-4d9b-a9fb-2e57801f9399))
	- The article itself is focused on natural resources like endangered species, but does a good job of highlighting #Ostrom and explaining how problematic #Hardin’s (racist) scarcity mindset is

- Ok I made a first draft of [open source and the tragedy of the commons](((63bb069a-929c-459a-8df8-6baa097dd466)))
	- I need to flesh out the following terms so we can have a common understanding: [[Public Goods]], [[Common Goods]], [[Club Goods]], [[Private Goods]]
- Talking to [[Lance Tracey]] about [[Post Web]] which is what I was mentioning to #Noosphere too
	- People are putting graphs online so that they can exist in a naming space where other people can link to stable URIs — to participate in the web, search crawling, social links, etc etc
	- Like in part the “job to be done” is getting your stuff onto the web
	- But getting it onto the web isn’t the job itself
	- So if Noosphere can give us stable  content addresses and names — and a way to communicate / link between people — that’s the #JTBD!
	- Search, discovery, and (human) communication as “the” features

		- > I think we will need to sign everything to signify its validity. When I say sign, I am thinking cryptographically signed, like you sign a transaction in your web3 wallet.
