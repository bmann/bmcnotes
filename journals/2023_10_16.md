- My [[Cloudron]] work in moving over a bunch of domains that I also use with Gmail nuked some of the settings
	- [Gmail Set up SPF, DKIM & DMARC for your organization](https://support.google.com/a/answer/10583557?sjid=15869668522907536435-NA) #email #Gmail #DKIM #DMARC
	- SPF `"v=spf1 a:my.commonscomputer.com include:_spf.google.com ~all"`
	- Looks like my `bmannconsulting.com` domain had my old cloudron attached so that kept working. Fixed this quickly in DNS
	- DKIM had never been setup for `bmann.ca`, so adding the Google details (Cloudron sets this up as well, on it's own subdomain)
- Installed [[Nextcloud]] on [[Commons Computer]]
	- It really does have a ton of features
	- I could see running an entire organization off this ... but I'm also having like a visceral reaction to the entire interface; would I _want_ to be part of an org that gets work done using this?
- I want to turn off some other services like the long running [[Venture Scouts]] Discourse
	- It's on a really old version and I _could_ upgrade it and then migrate it to [[Commons Computer]]
	- Or, archive it. I found this recent Discourse Archive tool written in #Python https://github.com/jamesob/discourse-archive
		- Got an error, filed a bug
	- Maybe this works with [[wget]]
		- ```
		  wget --adjust-extension --mirror --page-requisites --convert-links   --recursive  --user-agent "Googlebot" https://venturescouts.ca
		  ```
