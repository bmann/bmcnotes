			- Autonomous Worlds and digital first shared communities are increasing in importance. I've been building open source, online, and in person communities for 20 years, and I want to discuss and ground how communities participate, own, govern, and enjoy digital spaces together. How can digital spaces inform physical spaces and create strong ties that lead to resilience at regional and global levels.
			- Areas of interest:
				- platforms vs protocols
				- community ownership
				- supporting both strong and weak ties
				- hybrid events and spaces
				- mobile first experiences
				- digital governance, voice and exit, user owned data
