- I'm deleting [[DMARC]] entries from my DNS
	- ```
	  "v=DMARC1; p=reject; pct=100"
	  ```
	- Which apparently fixed things? I gave [[Commons Computer]] #Cloudron a couple of domains that have Google email attached
	- It sets up a bunch of SPF and DKIM settings automatically and I needed to go back in and edit SPF settings so Google could send
	- I donâ€™t think DMARC not being there will hurt anything
