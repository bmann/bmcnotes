- [[microfeed]], a lightweight #CMS focused on feeds, #serverless on #Cloudflare
	- From the [[Dec 27th, 2022]] [intro post](https://www.microfeed.org/i/introducing-microfeed-a-self-hosted-open-source-cms-on-cloudflare-open-alpha-uhbQEmArlC2/):
		- > The self-hosted microfeed instance is deployed via GitHub Actions and runs on Cloudflare's serverless platform, taking advantage of products like [Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/), [R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/r2/), [D1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/), and [Zero Trust](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/).
		  > 
		  > Your microfeed instance can distribute content through a customizable website, an RSS feed (compatible with [podcast RSS](https://help.apple.com/itc/podcasts_connect/#/itcb54353390)), and a [JSON feed](https://www.jsonfeed.org/). And with the simple, yet powerful admin dashboard, adding new content to your feed is a breeze.

- [[Tim Bray]] [Private and Public Mastodon](https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2022/12/30/Mastodon-Privacy-and-Search), a round up of the controversial discussion around full text #search in #Mastodon
	- From _Corbulo_ in the blog comments:
	  > The principle behind it is 'decentralization', but decentralization is heavily dependent on indexing. Thats why Google was made and became so popular. A good search engine is less critical to a centralized net.

- I’ve turned off importing of my @boris@toolsforthought.rocks and @boris@plnetwork.xyz
	- I [turned it on](https://blog.bmannconsulting.com/2022/12/11/one-feed-to.html) [[Dec 11th, 2022]], so it was a short experiment
	- Ultimately importing a #Mastodon #RSS feed, while supported in [[Micro.blog]], looked bad and was even worse when cross posted to Twitter by Mb
	- So, short personal posts go from [[BMC/Microblog]]
