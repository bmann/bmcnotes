- My [[Mac Mini]] spontaneously rebooted again yesterday and I reshuffled everything
  collapsed:: true
	- Why did it reboot? Unclear if it’s the 3rd party RAM I installed, the funky Kickstarter USB-C dock I have, or bitrot because it’s the “last Intel Mac Mini”
	- I ordered a [[KVM Switch]], the [[Visiontek VT2900]]
	- The difference between [[Docking Stations]] and KVM Switch are pretty minimal these days with USB-C and usually just one hot plug cable to move
	- I decided to get the switch because it’s how I think I will use it: plugging in my laptop and using that, but also having another permanent desktop machine there
	- That might mean re-purposing the Mac Mini with #NixOS as a server
	- Or maybe I get an [[Intel NUC]] or other minimal server or a #System76 [mini server](https://system76.com/desktops/meerkat)
	- In the future, a dock that works with the [[Steam Deck]] might also plugin?
