- Chatting with @flancian who was wondering if he should support the [[Simply Jekyll]] margin note syntax in [[Anagora]].
  - Specifically “what do you call this freak of nature???” when he saw the markup 😅
  - I’ll do a search and replace at some point to convert everything to [[Littlefoot]] which is probably worth a write up [[TO DO]] [[Implementing Littlefoot for footnotes]]. 
  - The install was completed right at the end of my birthday [[Feb 22nd, 2021]]
- [Gurlic](https://gurlic.com) looks interesting:
- > Gurlic is an experiment in building a new/old kind of internet community. It is primarily a place for discovering and sharing technology, science, culture and the arts.
- That’s from the [about page](https://gurlic.com/about), which continues with principles that make for an important and inspiring read. The one about domains stands out:
- > Every resource (user, community, publication etc.) must be mappable to custom user-owned domain names.
- Basically: even though this is a shared platform, you can bring your own domain and truly own it.
