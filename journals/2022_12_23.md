- [Pace layers in science and technology](https://science-in-the-digital-era.khinsen.net/#Pace%20layers%20in%20science%20and%20technology) by [[Konrad Hinsen]] via [[Gordon Brander]] and [Noosphere Subconscious Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1003419732516552724/1006037244815089715/1055857821079580682) #[[pace layering]]
- Had a catch up call with [[Rosano]]
  collapsed:: true
	- “Welcome to the show” edition
	- In #Berlin
	- Looking at a hack on the beach event
	- Some travel to Vietnam, Malaysia
		- Vietnamese food recommendations from a [recent meal at Do Chay](https://foodwiki.bmann.ca/Do%2520Chay%2520Kingsway%2520Dec%252015th.html) #foodwiki
		- Specifically Banh Xeo Crepe
	- Consolidating on [[Ghost]] for lots of things
		- Members -> Apps -> Updates, where Updates from apps are available to all users
		- Maybe take Ghost content and put it in GitHub so people can make updates, push back into Ghost?
		- Sort of [[Headless CMS]]
		- Fission site works this way, Ghost as editing interface, then [[Eleventy]] for pulling content via API and publishing static site
		- [Working with Eleventy](https://ghost.org/docs/jamstack/eleventy/) on the #Ghost site
			- [[Eleventy Starter Ghost]]
	- Working on a new app for [[QR code]] generation
	- What is Rosano using for hosting these days?
		- No more [[Heroku]]
		- Talked a bit about beyond Docker / LAMP stack apps to [[12 Factor App]]
		- Lots of [[n8n]] for automation
		- [[Cloudron]]
			- Pays for annual Cloudron license
			- Uses it for one click apps - Ghost installs, a URL redirect, etc
			- Not really using it for custom apps
		- [[CapRover]]
			- It isn’t really multi user at all
			- Single admin user / pass
			- Uses it for all his NodeJS apps
			- $10/month server
		- [[Render]]
			- Free static apps
			- Paying for one dyno
		- Boris’ phrase: [[self hosting is selfish]]
		- Boris is running [[PhotoPrism]] https://photos.bmannconsulting.com
			- like a self-hosted Google Photos
			- Runs on [[Digital Ocean]] but needs a pretty hefty server, like $20/month
			- Just barely getting multi users
			- I would like to share this with at least 4 people -> $5/month
			- Plus at least one other person with server access, knowing how to upgrade / maintain the software
		- Can we share Cloudron?
			- Saves money by sharing price of a subscription
			- Shared server costs - but will also need a slightly larger server
			- Sharing admin / updates
			- Comingling and interdependence: what if stuff Boris runs takes down the server? What if what Rosano runs takes it down?
	- [[Railway]]
		- Boris looking at this as Heroku successor
		- They use [[Nixpacks]] instead of [[Buildpacks]]
	- Jank: general description of software and systems that work, mostly, but have a little, you know, jank associated
- [[Go QR]], a #[[QR code]] generator that is free to use. Supports #vCard
- Thinking about importing or linking to things from the [[Fission Wiki]]
  collapsed:: true
	- basically adding a property to certain things that are a link to the [[Fission]] Discourse forum

	- > So I’m still converting the content to [Markdown](https://taoofmac.com/space/markup/markdown), but with nearly 9000 posts and Wiki pages here, it may take a while yet. I’m not in a hurry.
	- Linking to [20 Years of Tao of Mac](https://taoofmac.com/space/blog/20)
- I’m feeling the same way about chipping away at this #LogSeqConversion
  collapsed:: true
	- Well, not just the chipping away of conversion, but rather that the workflow and practice
	- Although the temporary subdomain of `logseq.bmannconsulting.com` is…temporary
	- The plan is to fully migrate to `bmannconsulting.com`
	- Blockers are figuring out how to do proper “blog post” style pages with LogSeq
	- Plus converting / migrating / adjusting the blog and archive
	- I don’t want to necessarily wreck what is there now, but maybe it just doesn’t matter
	- The Daily Journals here are “personal” in the sense that it’s just me writing, not necessarily for publication
		- But it’s not personal in the sense that I keep it to tech / business topics
		- My [[Micro.blog]] site https://blog.bmannconsulting.com has photos and food and stuff
		- But! Because I don’t have a good blogging workflow, it has some articles there that would make more sense here, like [this one](https://blog.bmannconsulting.com/2022/06/02/kickstarting-an-app.html)
		- Plus #foodwiki as the other space I have that is my personal log
