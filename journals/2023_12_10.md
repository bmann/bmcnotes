- If your domains / email are with [[NetNation]], that is actually [[Hostway]], and these #email settings are what you need to set up your IMAP and SMTP https://support.hostway.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000368264-How-do-I-configure-my-email-client-General-Instructions-#imap-settings
	- Webmail is available at https://webmail.netnation.com/appsuite
	- If your MX records are `mx.siteprotect.com` for a domain (use [[dnsrecords.io]] to check), this should work
- For [[Mattermost]] on #Cloudron, you can go into `/app/data/config.json` and change settings #[[Commons Computer]]
	- In this case, I have my first user that never confirmed email and so can't login, so turned off email confirmation
- Also learned that for #Cloudron, outbound email settings are per domain
	- So setup #Mailgun for #DWebYVR [[MediaWiki]]
	- I had made changes to this for [[Ghost]] #Cloudron setup, and that had likely messed up email for other things there
