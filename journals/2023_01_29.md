	- Explains #ActivityPub, actor model, #JSON-LD, and more, including a hilarious way of describing public / private keys
	- > Your public key is the smell of your breath, since anyone can come up to you and smell it. Now whenever you author an activity, you’ll create a signature, by licking the activity. Only you can create this signature, and other people can verify it’s yours based on the smell of your breath. (This is a very bad analogy, but it makes up for that by being fun!)
