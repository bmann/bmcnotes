- Past midnight, but got [[BMC/Homepage]] up at https://bmannconsulting.com
	- Had to do the usual Ruby yakshaving to get things working both locally and in Github Actions
	- Installed [[rbenv]] and got things on 3.1.4
	- This tip on [reading the .ruby-version into your Gemfile](https://andycroll.com/ruby/read-ruby-version-in-your-gemfile/) was kind of neat #Ruby
	- But what I actually had to do was update it in the Github Actions file
