- Had to do the usual Ruby yakshaving to get things working both locally and in Github Actions
	- Installed [[rbenv]] and got things on 3.1.4
	- This tip on [reading the .ruby-version into your Gemfile](https://andycroll.com/ruby/read-ruby-version-in-your-gemfile/) was kind of neat #Ruby
	- But what I actually had to do was update it in the Github Actions file
- [Some things to know about Mastodon](https://maria-antoniak.github.io/2023/07/04/notes-on-mastodon.html) by [[Maria Antoniak]] #Mastodon
	- > This is a list of things I think are important to understand if you’re new to Mastodon. A lot of how Mastodon works isn’t immediately clear, but the effects of how it’s designed can have a big impact on your experience.
- [[Manton Reece]] [Next Steps for Activity Pub](https://www.manton.org/2023/07/25/next-step-for.html) #ActivityPub
	- Responding to [[Dave Winer]], talking about interop and standards, including a common posting API; the #Mastodon/API is used rather than AP or #micropub
	- > ActivityPub is not really one thing. There’s the [ActivityPub spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/) itself, but also [ActivityStreams](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/), [HTTP Signatures](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-cavage-http-signatures), [WebFinger](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7033), [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/), and the working group [note on authentication](https://www.w3.org/wiki/SocialCG/ActivityPub/Authentication_Authorization).

	- > ActivityPub is too hard for most people to implement on a whim. What would it take to allow developers to create something that sits on the fediverse inside of an afternoon?
- Reminded of [[BlotIM]], which is a very simple hosted #SSG that works by syncing a Dropbox folder, #Google/Drive, or Git repo
	- It [supports wikilinks](https://blot.im/how/posts/wikilinks) and specifically talks about using it with [[Obsidian]]
	- With Google Drive or Dropbox, I could see this perhaps being useful for less technical users in jointly maintaining a #[[Digital Garden]]
	- Yes, it’s also open source and technically self hostable
- [[Eric Scouten]] [pointed me at](https://ericscouten.social/@scouten/110803759453900071) the [[Zola]] #Rust #SSG, which I tried back in [[Mar 14th, 2021]]
	- I did a quick search and found [[obsidian-zola]] for making a #[[Digital Garden]] site with it
- [The Fediverse has a Mental Health Problem](https://medium.com/@thisismissem/the-fediverse-has-a-mental-health-problem-4cb4845dfee1) by [[Emelia Smith]]
	- > We’ve also seen various contributors start to face financial hardships given the lack of funding available for their crucially important work. I know this first hand, as [my personal savings being decimated](https://hachyderm.io/@thisismissem/110795405584288634)whilst I struggle to make contributing to the fediverse sustainable — and I’m not alone here.
	- There are a couple of topics being covered here, but at its core is #[[commons funding]] and the “classic” problem of financially supporting #opensource maintainers
	- What’s new is the additional issue of operating #DecentSocial servers — from hosting to moderation — on a volunteer basis
	- Users have expectations that have been set by global corporate advertising based platforms, and often times don’t care about open source or federation
- [A long delayed golden age: or why has the ICT ‘installation period’ lasted so long?](https://medium.com/iipp-blog/a-long-delayed-golden-age-or-why-has-the-ict-installation-period-lasted-so-long-b3471a0aaaeb) by [[Carlota Perez]]
	- > after four revolutions replacing manual labour, the new technologies have found an enormous new territory to mechanise: mental labour! This has led MIT’s Brynjolfsson and McAfee and many others to consider it as the beginning of a ‘[second machine age](https://library.villanova.edu/Find/Record/1499477/TOC)’. Nevertheless, even if that can prolong the experimental installation period, it should not stop a golden age from being unleashed.
	- [Cryptography may offer a solution to the massive AI-labeling problem](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/07/28/1076843/cryptography-ai-labeling-problem-c2pa-provenance/) [[MIT Technology Review]]
		- Covers [[C2PA]] as well as it’s relevance for #LLM content
		- > Launched two years ago, it’s an open-source internet protocol that relies on cryptography to encode details about the origins of a piece of content, or what technologists refer to as “provenance” information.
		- > The project, part of the nonprofit [Joint Development Foundation](https://jointdevelopment.org/), was started by Adobe, Arm, Intel, Microsoft, and Truepic, which formed the [Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity](https://c2pa.org/) (from which C2PA gets its name). Over 1,500 companies are now involved in the project through the closely affiliated open-source community, [Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI)](https://contentauthenticity.org/), including ones as varied and prominent as Nikon, the BBC, and Sony.
