- Had to do the usual Ruby yakshaving to get things working both locally and in Github Actions
	- Installed [[rbenv]] and got things on 3.1.4
	- This tip on [reading the .ruby-version into your Gemfile](https://andycroll.com/ruby/read-ruby-version-in-your-gemfile/) was kind of neat #Ruby
	- But what I actually had to do was update it in the Github Actions file
- [Some things to know about Mastodon](https://maria-antoniak.github.io/2023/07/04/notes-on-mastodon.html) by [[Maria Antoniak]] #Mastodon
	- > This is a list of things I think are important to understand if you’re new to Mastodon. A lot of how Mastodon works isn’t immediately clear, but the effects of how it’s designed can have a big impact on your experience.

	- Responding to [[Dave Winer]], talking about interop and standards, including a common posting API; the #Mastodon/API is used rather than AP or #micropub
	- > ActivityPub is not really one thing. There’s the [ActivityPub spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/) itself, but also [ActivityStreams](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/), [HTTP Signatures](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-cavage-http-signatures), [WebFinger](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7033), [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/), and the working group [note on authentication](https://www.w3.org/wiki/SocialCG/ActivityPub/Authentication_Authorization).

	- > ActivityPub is too hard for most people to implement on a whim. What would it take to allow developers to create something that sits on the fediverse inside of an afternoon?
- Reminded of [[BlotIM]], which is a very simple hosted #SSG that works by syncing a Dropbox folder, #Google/Drive, or Git repo
	- It [supports wikilinks](https://blot.im/how/posts/wikilinks) and specifically talks about using it with [[Obsidian]]
	- With Google Drive or Dropbox, I could see this perhaps being useful for less technical users in jointly maintaining a #[[Digital Garden]]
	- Yes, it’s also open source and technically self hostable
- [[Eric Scouten]] [pointed me at](https://ericscouten.social/@scouten/110803759453900071) the [[Zola]] #Rust #SSG, which I tried back in [[Mar 14th, 2021]]
	- I did a quick search and found [[obsidian-zola]] for making a #[[Digital Garden]] site with it
