- “A version of a thing is a ~40 char string of hex noise”
	- Via [[Erlend]] #Subconscious/Discord, this is [[Graydon Hoare]] explaining how the affordance of hashes-as-versions became normalized. [@graydon@types.pl](https://types.pl/@graydon/110861102851461741)

	- > (IMO this is also why all the web3 stuff as well as secure p2p messaging like SSB and nostr had their moments when they did: elliptic curve crypto finally meant a public signing key could be "a ~32 char string of hex noise", which is actually a psychologically tolerable threshold in UI we hadn't previously identified, but is real. Dropping below the "full page of hex" RSA/DSA key-size mattered.)
