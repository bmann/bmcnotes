- Left [[Rosano]] a rambling audio message about my practice of using this #LogSeq space
	- I just spent a bunch of time updating the [[colophon]] with details on how this site works and its history
	- I lapsed using it in part because I'm frustrated with how it publishes to [[BMC/Garden]]
	- [[How to publish LogSeq to GitHub Pages]] works
		- As does [[Publish LogSeq from Mobile]]
		- But, it's a single 40MB+ index.html file!
		- And, "article" publishing isn't really great. Ideally I could throw a tag or property onto a page and get a better article version.
	- I'm waiting for [[Noosphere]], where of course the [[Subconscious/Subtext]] text format may well cause it's own issues
	- I was talking in the [[Subconscious/Discord]] and they did mention that for Noosphere, they'd love to have a LogSeq plugin as well
	- I also love my [[foodwiki]], which is a similarily complicated #TiddlyWiki static publishing, which I maintain 100% using [[Quine]]
	- But on the question of "why is it important to take or publish notes"
		- I do it for me first, as I have always done for blogging, too
		- I have notes like this that I can come back to, and especially how to's or install details, are very useful
		- I hope to get better at "asking questions of my notes"
		- If I'm going to write something up to share with someone, chances are its useful for other people, so why not publish it so it can be easily shared
		- My style for personal stuff is pretty documentarian heavy -- so [[BMC/Microblog]] is adventures and food
		- Questions I ask of my foodwiki and microblog are along the lines of "where were we last year" or "what was that place that Rosano took us to on south Main"
		- Long ago and far away, I got excited by blogging and publishing because I connected with other people, a lot!
		- I think I owe a lot to blogging
		- I say I was one of the first 1000 bloggers -- no idea if that was true; but that's how "small" the people publishing in 2001 felt
			- We read each others' blogs, and re-blogged, and commented, and wrote back and forth, with a cadence of days/weeks
		- Also: it was the beginning of SEO, and it was exciting that my Drupal blog ranked highly for a ton of things, so I had people stop by and comment from all over
		- Most of these feelings / interactions have been eaten by broadcast social media and [[cozy web]] spaces like Discord servers or Signal groups
		- But, it's hard to use posts into social media as an archive even just for yourself when its on someone else's platform
		- Using [[BMC/Microblog]], I have it set to cross-publish to my #CoSocial Mastodon account and to #Bluesky
			- MicroBlog I have high confidence that I can export from
			- With CoSocial and Bluesky, I am leaning into them more also because I "trust" that that content will persist: both socially (CoSocial is a co-op I help run and I know it's backed up) and technically (I own my username on Bluesky, and their [[AT Protocol/Personal Data Server]] model means I'll eventually run my own)
			- But: the content isn't here so it's not searchable or cross-indexable to the rest of the #[[Second Brain]] here unless I link to it / copy it here
		- And chat is ephemeral. At best, you write stuff here and drop it into social media or chat -- so you have a copy, and that at least has a chance of being discoverable by others
- Did some tinkering with the [[Boris Mann/Home Lab]] setup
  collapsed:: true
	- Deleted the `expandcontract.org` #Discourse forum on [[Digital Ocean]]
	- Created a new Ubuntu 22.10 server 2GB RAM / 50GB in TOR1 Toronto #[[Digital Ocean]] data center
	- Went to #Cloudflare and set up `gateway.bmann.ca` to point to this machine
	- Some articles and setup
		- [Build A Portable Lab In The Cloud Using Tailscale, Terraform and DigitalOcean](https://rossedman.io/blog/computers/scale-homelab-with-tailscale/) #Terraform #homelab #[[Digital Ocean]]
			- Not quite ready to go Terraform although it's a good idea
			- Will install #nginx `apt-get install -y nginx`
		- [Tailscale Based VPN on DigitalOcean Droplet](https://sergeykibish.com/blog/tailscale-based-vpn-on-digitalocean-droplet/) #Tailscale #[[Digital Ocean]]
			- Not going to use most of this, but let's start by [installing Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/download/linux/)
			- `curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh`
			- What I should have done is `tailscale up --advertise-exit-node` but needed to do it afterwards
			- And now [IP Forwarding needs to be enabled](https://tailscale.com/kb/1019/subnets/?tab=linux#enable-ip-forwarding)
			- I'm not following the firewall steps, at least not yet
	- Apparently my #[[Mac Mini]] rebooted and didn't fully restart at some point
		- Those Docker services including the [[Nextcloud AIO]] restarted and are connected to Tailscale again, but it skipped some sort of setup step and is now asking for an admin login, so I'll need to delete / re-run those docker containers I guess
		- And, use `gateway.bmann.ca` as the domain? or `nextcloud.bmann.ca` or something
		- Which is the part I need to figure out with Tailscale

- Had a shower thought that I [posted to Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/bmann.ca/post/3k2lde2kel22t)
	- We’re in a post printing press, post telephone world.
	  
	  But we’re in the messy middle of figuring out the Internet.
	- What do we need to work on?
	  
	  Engaging with and understanding the “governance stack” that both includes physical wires & servers and hard national borders and laws…
	  
	  …and all the other software stuff that’s sort of everywhere.

- I set up the [[DWebYVR/Drop-In]] sessions
	- Emailed [[The Permanent]] about if those dates are available
- Found [[fossilizer]], which turns your #Mastodon export into a static site

	- Exactly relevant to what I was talking about with [[Rosano]] earlier today
