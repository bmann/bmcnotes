- [Responding](https://social.coop/@bmann/109729730480058220) to [[Ben Werdmuller]]’s prompt about if a journalism [[Venture Studio]] makes sense, what about a [[co-op studio]]
	- I have started thinking about co-op studios.
	- Venture is pooling capital for a return for both the operators (GPs) and the investors (LPs).
	- Co-op principles include supporting other co-ops, and there are a variety of support / services co-ops.
	- You can create co-ops with shares and even return capital, dividends, or interest to them.
