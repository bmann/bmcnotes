- Just reading through [[Yancey Strickler]]’s [[The Dark Forest Theory of the Internet]] again as I add it here since it’s linked from [[Moving Castles: Modular and Portable Multiplayer Miniverses]]
	- Uh… while he tags [[The Three Body Problem]] book right at the top, he is defining #[[dark forest]] as the _opposite_ of how I think about it
	-
	- No no — the Internet at large is a dark forest. The private spaces are #[[cozy web]]
	- Anyway, it’s a good article. The ending, which talks about large open platforms becoming more dangerous as people of good intent leave, is very telling as people set up shop on #Mastodon
