- Just reading through [[Yancey Strickler]]’s [[The Dark Forest Theory of the Internet]] again as I add it here since it’s linked from [[Moving Castles: Modular and Portable Multiplayer Miniverses]]
	- Uh… while he tags [[The Three Body Problem]] book right at the top, he is defining #[[dark forest]] as the _opposite_ of how I think about it
	-
	- No no — the Internet at large is a dark forest. The private spaces are #[[cozy web]]
	- Anyway, it’s a good article. The ending, which talks about large open platforms becoming more dangerous as people of good intent leave, is very telling as people set up shop on #Mastodon

	- Well, this is an argument for [[POSSE]]
	- The way I do this with [[Micro.blog]], where posts flow to #Twitter, isn’t cross posting
	- It’s using MicroBlog as a “client” to post to multiple places — like #linkedin and [[Tumblr]]
	- Here’s the write up on [feeds in Micro.blog](https://book.micro.blog/microblog-and-feeds/) — the Mb docs and settings are hard to find when searching so I’m not even sure that’s totally up to date
	- This lead me to Belle B. Cooper’s post on [leaving Micro.blog](https://bellebcooper.com/blog/leaving-microblog) and reminded me that I have all these same complaints (chief among them: not open source) but have stuck with it from frustration of having to run my own relatively fragile service
	- [[indiekit]] on #Heroku was great other than an issue eventually with images not working
		- LATER Get #indiekit running on [[Railway]]
		- I need the #Fission append endpoint for image uploads…
