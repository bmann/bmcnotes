- I finished revamping [[BMC]] back into using [[Digital Garden Jekyll Template]] #Jekyll
  collapsed:: true
	- I went back to my master branch of my [[BMC]] github https://github.com/bmann/bmcgarden (since I've still been running off the `logseqconversion` branch) and made a `dgjekyll` branch to work with
	- This is mostly pretty easy to work with and hack. I grabbed the newest version of the template code, the code for blog and archive works fine still
	- I exported the pages directory from this #LogSeq just to see if it would work for publishing
	- #DGJ has some helper code to add empty front matter and I did the usual #Jekyll version yakshaving, reverted to kramdown from CommonMark GH Pages processor
	- Everything is checked in and building, and I published locally using [[IPFS Desktop]] and then pinned it to [[Web3Storage]], so a snapshot is available here https://bafybeid6ngle6jqiadrc6lxjootgc7wqn33zaixf5wka3uqw7pv4kf7uym.ipfs.dweb.link/
		- I noticed some other errata, like it ended up publishing with html extensions so setting `use_html_extension:  true` in the `_config.yml` and trying this again
		- And one more time. `use_html_extension:  true`, BUT, all the permalinks use trailing slashes, which forces a folder and `index.html` to be created
		- Among other things, this is painful to keep doing because it takes 145 seconds to build each time!
		- It really is nice to have this all published "locally" with my desktop #IPFS node, too!
- [[Brian Wisti]] did a write up on [LogSeq Export Formats](https://randomgeekery.org/post/2022/03/logseqs-export-formats/) -- I'm not using the export function, I literally just copied over the `pages` folder #LogSeq/Export
	- Just realized that [Brian has my micro blog on his neighborhood page](https://randomgeekery.org/neighborhood/) of people he follows, cool :)
	- It's vaguely a pointer to my #[[BMC/Microblog]], since I don't actually have active RSS feeds from LogSeq
	- He's also been blogging since around 2000 or so, like me
- Now, am I actually going to publish like this? Here's the errata:
  collapsed:: true
	- There are some conflicts with Jekyll and Liquid templating, which uses curly brackets
	- The various embed commands in LogSeq, as well as queries, I commented out or deleted
	- The LogSeq "front matter", which I use pretty heavily with attributes like `link::` , `tags::`, `author::`and more , all still exist in the files and look ugly when published
	- I _could_ transform those to Jekyll front matter key/value pairs instead, with a fair bit of custom coding
	- No aliases support, so some wikilinks will not actually link
- Ultimately, the front matter, which I make pretty heavy use of for custom data, both looks bad and would need extensive Jekyll coding to make work
  collapsed:: true
	- Are journals, which I update regularly, more interesting to publish?
	- They don't have front matter
	- Many of them link to external links directly
	- It's still an export-to-Markdown and then manual process to publish
	- I _could_ do a manual weekly "blog" post
- Let's experiment with importing all the journals
  collapsed:: true
	- Copy over the export-to-Markdown journals folder
	- Rename to `_journals` and create a journals Jekyll collection
	- Debug my config YAML because the hyphen at the end is slightly in the wrong spot
	- Copy the blog listing page and make a journal page which lists the last 30 journals
	- Yeah, I don't know if I can turn pages that are just "named" after dates into actual dates, because it would be nice to have a monthly log kind of like the yearly archive page
	- Oh right, there's no front matter, so need to adapt the #DGJ helper script to work on journals, too
	- Various learnings about #Jekyll collections and slugs and such. TLDR; collections don't have `:slug` but do have `:name` which is the same thing
	- So here's the version with journals included https://bafybeighc6qelchfvirhycetechzb6eiwr3opo4wuvy4g7ph6vxh4qehwe.ipfs.dweb.link/
		- Except the journals don't get parsed for wikilinks
		- The way LogSeq outline works, this looks even worse than usual, with blockquotes and other elements not working well with lists
		- I'd need to strip the bulleted lists and do something like top level outline anchor tags
- So i've now spent a couple of evenings seeing what #LogSeq to #Jekyll looks like, and I don't think it makes sense to do this at all. Instead, I'm going to do something like this:
	- TODO Remove the blog and archive posts from #LogSeq
		- There are some wikilinks in some of the newer blog posts, but I can also manually them to notes pages
	- LATER Adjust #DGJ wikilink parsing to make it point to LogSeq notes of the form [[wikilink]] -> `/#/page/wikilinks`
	- TODO Remove my structured [[Home]] page for LogSeq and just have it default to Daily Journals
		- Move that structured home page to the blog as a way to deeplink into interesting parts of my Digital Garden
	- TODO Publish #LogSeq to `notes.bmannconsulting.com`
		- Because the other way around, `blog` conflicts with [[BMC/Microblog]], and having a nicely readable home / root page is good, actually
		- Kind of how I've ended up with [[BMC/bmann.ca]]
- What have I learned?
	- I like tinkering with my own website
	- #Jekyll is something I've spent a lot of time with so it's quick and easy
	- I should probably throw more hours at #Eleventy instead
	- I really don't gel with #Hugo and I'd probably put more stuff into [[Micro.blog]] if I wasn't annoyed with how hard it is to hack themes there / how clunky I find Hugo to work with
		- I'm happy with Micro.blog for its cross posting and that I can now very reliably use it for photo uploading
	- Publishing stuff to #IPFS on my local machine and then pinning it to [[Web3Storage]] so that I have live captures of interim outputs is **great**!
	- I really do like the default mode of how I use #LogSeq for daily journals in particular
	- I like [[Littlefoot]] footnotes for full blog posts
