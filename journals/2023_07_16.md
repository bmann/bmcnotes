- Call with [[Rosano]]
	- Rosano had sent me some questions
		- the bit i was trying to get at is the tendency to "structure/nodeify all the things" when using graph tools like logseq/roamâ€”was wondering how much it pays off for the kind of notes you take
		- why it still seems to be hard on mobile
		- why publishing notes seems to keep turning into heavy js apps
		- not that those things are bad, but if the tools are meant to support your process then how might it do so sustainably/effortlessly without lapses.
