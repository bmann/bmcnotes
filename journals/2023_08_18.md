	- > In April 2023, I began working with the [Interledger Foundation](https://interledger.org/) as a technical ambassador to advance [Web Monetization](https://webmonetization.org/) in [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) and other applications using [ActivityPub](https://activitypub.rocks/). ActivityPub is a W3C standard that adds a social layer to the Web platform. It enables any website or app to have social networking functionality that can interoperate with other websites and apps. Instead of everyone having to join one social network, people can now pick a social network provider like they can pick an email provider. My project’s goal is to adapt Web Monetization to work within federated social networks with Mastodon being the reference implementation.
