- *One of my favorite Engelbart sayings might relate to the ‘Mastodon is too confusing to learn’ claim. Paraphrasing, he said that if ease of use was the ultimate aim for a tool, the bicycle would never have evolved beyond the tricycle.* [[Howard Rheingold]] [[Nov 17th, 2022]] [mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@hrheingold/109361602358234331) #Mastodon #quote #[[Douglas Engelbart]]

- [Everyone’s Illustrated Primer](https://acroll.substack.com/p/everyones-illustrated-primer) by [[Alistair Croll]] #AI
	- As usual, [we aren’t thinking weird enough](https://acroll.substack.com/p/we-arent-thinking-weird-enough-1f6f947542ac)—both about what’s possible, and about what might go wrong.
	  
	  * We worry about someone using AI to write a book, rather than whether we’ll still read books.
	  * We worry about AI writing term papers, rather than whether schools will become obsolete.

	- [[Ben Adida]] has been posting about / asking some pointed questions, like [this one about search](https://mastodon.adida.net/@ben/109605040983358553)
	- [[Derek Powazek]] shares about the early days at [[Technorati]]
		- Talking about search on Mastodon and having flashbacks to when I was the designer for Technorati. There was a beautiful moment there where blogs weren't indexed by Google and we were building a truly community-centric product, with tag pages and a blog directory and plans for way more. And it all got eaten when Google started indexing blogs. Another moment the fediverse should probably learn from.
