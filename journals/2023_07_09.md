- Back to some [[Boris Mann/Home Lab]] work
	- Yesterday I plugged in the [[VisionTek/VT2900]] KVM switch and got things working again
	- I'm actually back in "new Mac setup" as well, because I updated to [[MacOS/Ventura]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- Installed the [[Tailscale]] plugin for [[Docker/Desktop]]
		- Install [[Homebrew]]
		- Oh yeah, don't even have shell aliases here ðŸ¤ª
		- _time passes as I have fun updating a bunch of old LogSeq notes and pages_
	- [[Nextcloud AIO]] install notes
	  collapsed:: true
		- Searched a bunch of #Tailscale stuff, which is mostly people saying "I'm not quite sure what I'm doing"
		- I searched for AIO in Docker Desktop hub
		- You can't edit env vars in Docker Desktop? You just delete and try again?
		- Couldn't get it running using the graphical interface, did get it running using this command
		- `docker run --sig-proxy=false --name nextcloud-aio-mastercontainer --restart always --publish 8080:8080 --env APACHE_PORT=11000 --env APACHE_IP_BINDING=0.0.0.0 --env NEXTCLOUD_MOUNT=/Users/bmann/Documents/Nextcloud --volume nextcloud_aio_mastercontainer:/mnt/docker-aio-config --volume /var/run/docker.sock.raw:/var/run/docker.sock:ro nextcloud/all-in-one:latest`
		- That includes the raw socket needed on MacOS
		- Can't quite figure out what IP address to use / what Tailscale settings are needed to get to the right port
		- Can access it with `https://127.0.0.1:8080` -- but shows an error on localhost because it's not using https
		- Various other Tailscale DNS and IP addresses _do_ work, but stuck at figuring out a real domain name
		- There doesn't seem to be any definitive guides that can be found by searching

	- Emailed everyone from [[TrainJam]]
