	- > The key web 2 concepts were: letting users publish whatever they want (“user generated content” was a buzzword), social graphs, APIs and [mashups](https://avc.com/2006/08/business_develo/) (what we'd call [composability](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1451703067213066244?s=20&t=OMwnAHagQ1wsTRv-Bre-wA)today), defaulting profiles and photos to public vs private, and tagging over hierarchical navigation, among other things. There were also technical innovations. A seemingly simple but important one was web pages that updated dynamically without reloading the page, what was usually called [Ajax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)) and is now just the way people expect web apps to work. There were mobile devices that could access the open web but they were extremely niche (I was an avid [Sidekick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMNDqO2HjEU) user). #[[Web 2.0]]
	- > Another striking thing about that period was how small and passionate the web 2 community was. I remember in 2004 going to what I think might have been the first New York Tech meetup. The whole group fit in a small room in Meetup’s headquarters. People demoed software they had created and talked late into the evening.
	- > The basis of competition switched from creative idea generation to disciplined execution. You had to decide whether you wanted to be the idealistic band at the indy bar or be pragmatic — potentially making compromises — and play in stadiums.
	- > In retrospect, there was a convergence of three powerful trends: social media (by then that word was replacing web 2), cloud computing (which would enable the apps to scale server side), and the rise of smartphones. Independent product design spaces are multiplicative: even if social, cloud, and mobile each improved linearly, the combination could improve exponentially.
	- > Things that look interesting to smart people usually do so because they are rich with product possibilities. These possibilities eventually become reality. Toys become must-have tools. Weekend hobbies become mainstream activities. Cynics sound smart but optimists build the future.
