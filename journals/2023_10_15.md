- I ended up buying a [[Hostinger]] VPS for a year after a bunch of looking around, prompted by [[Boris Anthony]]
	- It's $12.99USD/month paid for 1 year
- I also bought a [[Cloudron]] license for a year
	- It's $15USD/month, or $180USD
	- Of course, I had to buy a domain for it, so I bought [[commonscomputer.com]]
	- Bought it at [[Cloudflare]] -- my first domain purchased there
		- [[Google Domains]] has been sold to [[Squarespace]] so I need to migrate away from there, as a future to do
		- Not really that comfortable with [[Namecheap]] any more
	- I setup [[Cal.com]], which I've been wanting to experiment with forever!
		- It's got quite a lot of setup steps, I'll have to go back and see about getting Google integration going
- Met with [[Jess Martin]] who is going to start monthly meetups for [[Tools for Thought Rocks]] again
	- The [[Tools for Thought Rocks/Mastodon]] is at [[Spacebear/Federation]]
	- I just bought `toolsforthought.social` on Cloudflare
	- I can set it up and have people move over to that server, and then cancel Spacebear
	- Can we host something at the root domain of [[Tools for Thought Rocks]] that is easy like SquareSpace?
	- I suggested that we actually DO use [[Obsidian]] and [[Quartz]], sharing via git -- we do this for [[DWebYVR]]
	- I do think that the web page for TFT should be a TFT :)
- Moved [[BMC/bmann.ca]] to a [[Surfer]] static site on Cloudron
	- https://bmann.ca has an updated Colophon
