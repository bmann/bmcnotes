This comprises widespread practices of publicly posting mundane code projects without a licence and with little to no documentation to help users understand these projects. According to Fuller et al., this ‘general indifference to the discussions of and loyalty to certain kinds of licences and the sense of ethics (GPL) or business models (Open Source) that these drew upon’ ([2017](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/13548565231205867#bibr17-13548565231205867): 58), marks a departure from the F/OSS movement’s practices.
