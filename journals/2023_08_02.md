- Looking at [[BMC/Homepage]] and tinkering with my [[.well-known]]
	- I already have a #Webfinger document from earlier experiments with using my email address as account login for #remotestorage, delegated to [[5apps]]
	- Found this neat hack, just add a redirect to your site! [Alias your Mastodon account to your own domain with Netlify Redirect](https://www.hawksworx.com/blog/alias-your-mastodon-username-to-your-domain-with-one-netlify-config-setting/)
	- I can do this as well with [[IPFS/Redirects]]
	- Note: you'll need to add `_redirects` to your `includes` command in your #Jekyll `config.yml` for it to pass through this file, as well as the `.well-known` folder
	- ```yaml
	  include: ['.well-known', '_redirects']
	  ```
- Adding to the [[BMC/Homepage]]
	- Colophon tweaks https://bmannconsulting.com/notes/colophon/
	- Made an #IPFS note https://bmannconsulting.com/notes/ipfs/
	- Trying to get the RSS feed fixed, since it's not validating right now. This #Jekyll fees repo is what I used as a base, need to double check it https://github.com/georgemandis/jekyll-rss-feeds/blob/master/feed.xml
