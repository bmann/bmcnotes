- Looking at [[BMC/Homepage]] and tinkering with my [[.well-known]]
	- I already have a #Webfinger document from earlier experiments with using my email address as account login for #remotestorage, delegated to [[5apps]]
	- Found this neat hack, just add a redirect to your site! [Alias your Mastodon account to your own domain with Netlify Redirect](https://www.hawksworx.com/blog/alias-your-mastodon-username-to-your-domain-with-one-netlify-config-setting/)
	- I can do this as well with [[IPFS/Redirects]]
	- Note: you'll need to add `_redirects` to your `includes` command in your #Jekyll `config.yml` for it to pass through this file, as well as the `.well-known` folder
	- ```yaml
	  include: ['.well-known', '_redirects']
	  ```
- Adding to the [[BMC/Homepage]]

	- Made an #IPFS note https://bmannconsulting.com/notes/ipfs/
	- Trying to get the RSS feed fixed, since it's not validating right now. This #Jekyll fees repo is what I used as a base, need to double check it https://github.com/georgemandis/jekyll-rss-feeds/blob/master/feed.xml
	- OK, my [RSS feed validates now](https://validator.w3.org/feed/check.cgi?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbmannconsulting.com%2Fblog.xml)
	- TODO Actually get [[BMC/Homepage]] `last_modified_at` working - it just shows the latest build date #[[BMC/Backlog]]
- Just discovered that my #Jekyll build system just sort of melted down?
  collapsed:: true
	- Two different ruby versions being mention?
	- Apparently I installed [[rbenv]] but had forgotten that I installed [[chruby]]
	- [Install Ruby with Chruby](https://mac.install.guide/ruby/12.html) #Ruby
		- The same set of guides has [[Homebrew]] only [instructions for installing Ruby](https://mac.install.guide/ruby/13.html) -- but I do need separate versions
	- Yes, this was an extremely #latenight / early morning
