- I got invited to [[Simon Wardley]]’s every two week “interesting people” video chat. Lots of discussion around [[Wardley Maps]], a bit of [[serverless]] thrown in. An interesting group of people. Some have tracked me down on either LinkedIn or Twitter.
- For the next call, the suggested topic is to look at applying mapping to health / healthcare.
- This connects directly to @tonzylstra’s recent post [It’s more logical to host an event than attend one](https://www.zylstra.org/blog/2021/03/its-more-logical-to-host-an-event-than-attend-one/).
- Someone day I will publish the extensive chat notes and article links between @hitsmachines and I, talking about [[NFT]]s and art.

- The answer to some of your questions currently are [xDai Chain](https://www.xdaichain.com/) and [Nifty.Ink](https://link.medium.com/0VDJGNyJteb).

- I posted the [[Back to IndieKit]] blog to Mastodon.

- I’m thinking about automating posts from this journal to Mastodon. The people there are likely interested in the type of stuff I post about. I would need to build a [[JSON Feed]] and then I can use my existing [[Micro.blog]] subscription to cross post.

- Hmmm. Since the [[Revue]] newsletter builder is part of Twitter now, and I looked at using it for Fission, maybe I’ll put the Journal feed into there, that could be interesting.
