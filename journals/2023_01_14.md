- [Searchtodon](https://searchtodon.social) was “Private Timeline Search for Mastodon” built by [[Jan Lehnardt]] #Mastodon
	- The post [announcing shutting it down](https://chaos.social/@janl/109688174599769864) has some commentary, there’s a retrospective still coming
	- Essentially there are Mastodon users who believe that none of their content should ever be stored anywhere even for personal, private use
	- It seems like anything not built into the Mastodon codebase is the most controversial
- Took some time to capture notes on #unconference approaches, including [[Open Space Technology]]
- Some comments on [[Arc Browser]] [by @bantg](https://twitter.com/bantg/status/1614270384420917251)
- Looking at #Ubuntu or #NixOS install on my [[Mac Mini]]

	- [[balena etcher]] is the recommended tool for flashing USB drives
	- I downloaded the NixOS image and flashed it onto a USB key
	- Various attempts to create partitions on my main drive isn't working, which is what happened before when I was trying this; my disk or partition or something is damaged
	- I'm using the KVM switch, but plugged the USB key directly into the mini, which I wasn't sure was going to work
	- I haven't been able to boot from that USB key or to have the boot selector come up, but recovery mode does work through the KVM switch
	- Booting into [[MacOS/Recovery Mode]] you need to fully power down, and then  hold Command-R or one of the other options while powering on
	- For me, after Command-Option-R, it asked to select a WiFi network and enter password, and then starts "Internet Recovery"
	- There was a 5-6 minute period and then rebooted into recovery with an option to install [[MacOS/Ventura]], which I guess is what it downloaded
	- I decided to go into Disk Utility and choose Erase, so a fresh install of [[MacOS/Ventura]] -- I'm writing some install notes there
