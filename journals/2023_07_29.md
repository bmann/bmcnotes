- [[Erin Kissane]] [Notes from a Mastodon migration](https://erinkissane.com/notes-from-a-mastodon-migration) #Mastodon
	- Kissane migrated and found some rough edges
	- > In practice, this means you’re trading being vulnerable to the whims of centralized corporate services and rich weirdos for…being vulnerable to the whims of whatever rando spins up a server, *unless*migration is speedy, comprehensive, and safe. That’s why it matters that migration is both clunky and surprisingly lossy.
	- I realized some of them too that I never considered — like you lose access to any Follower only posts, as well as DMs, because your new account ultimately does not have the same identity or authorization
- [[Erin Kissane]] [The affordance loop](https://erinkissane.com/the-affordance-loop) #Mastodon #Bluesky [[Jul 20th, 2023]]
	- > This is the affordance loop: Communities shape tools that shape communities, surrounded by everything happening in the world around us.
- [[delv]] is a [[dig]] replacement that understands #DNSSEC [made by the BIND team](https://kb.isc.org/docs/aa-01152) #DNS #cli
	- > `delv` checks the DNSSEC validation chain using the same code that is used by the BIND 9 DNS server itself. Compared to  `dig +sigchase`, `delv` is much closer to what really happens inside a DNS server.
- Finished [[Witch King]] by [[Martha Wells]] #fantasy #completed
- Starting [[Translation State]] by [[Ann Leckie]] #scifi #reading
- Split out LogSeq into a separate repo
	- Let's add that info here [[BMC/Logseq]]
	- Set DNS in #Cloudflare to point `notes.bmannconsulting.com` at Github
	- Working on getting Github Pages builds working with Github Actions
	- Maybe I need to make an [empty gh-pages branch first](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34100048/create-empty-branch-on-github) #git
	- Maybe I need to [give the workflow permission](https://github.com/JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action):
		- ```yaml
		  permissions:
		    contents: write
		  ```
		- Yep that did it
	- Completes ((64c5b66a-fb6b-4bf4-bde3-fa6bad04f0ec))
- Now to work on [[BMC/Homepage]]
	- I'm tinkering with the site and trying to write a blog post about what the heck I'm doing at the same time
	- I'm using [[Digital Garden Jekyll Template]] as the base for the site, but not actually doing notes with it
	- Is there another #jekyll #wikilinks plugin I might use?
	- Found [[jekyll-wikilinks]] which is part of [[Jekyll-Bonsai]]
		- It links to [other implementations](https://github.com/manunamz/jekyll-wikilinks#some-other-implementations) (including #DGJ )
			- https://github.com/jhvanderschee/brackettest is "a repository proves that Jekyll allows Wiki-style links using just Liquid"
