- I keep looking at [[Microlink]] so I guess I should at least post a quick journal log before I write it up more:

- From the [home page](https://microlink.io/):
- > Browser as API
> Fast, scalable, and reliable browser automation built for businesses and developers. Proudly open source.

- You can turn websites into structured data, take screenshots, turn pages into PDFs, and more. Power embeds, etc 

- The list of [open source components](https://microlink.io/oss) is super interesting. 

- [Brave Browser bought a search engine](https://www.theregister.com/2021/03/03/brave_buys_a_search_engine/), “promises no tracking, no profiling – and may even offer a paid-for, no-ad version”.

- Good timing for clearing my tabs of other [[Brave]] related stuff. This [PDF white paper describes the Brave Search Team’s plans](https://brave.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/goggles.pdf) — [[Goggles]]:

- > This paper proposes an open and collaborative system by which a community, or a single user, can create sets of rules and filters, called Goggles, to define the space which a search engine can pull results from. Instead of a single ranking algorithm, we could have as many as needed, overcoming the biases that a single actor (the search engine) embeds into the results.
