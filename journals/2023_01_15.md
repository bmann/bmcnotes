- [Continuing](logseq://graph/bmcgardenlogseq?block-id=63c3c7ed-96e1-42d4-be6f-7bd8b0aa5d4e) from attempting either a #NixOS or #Ubuntu install on the #[[Mac Mini]]
  collapsed:: true
	- Can't seem to get partition bootable
	- Finally got holding down option at boot working
	- [reFind](https://sourceforge.net/projects/refind/) is installed as per the [Make Use Of article](logseq://graph/bmcgardenlogseq?block-id=63c3c7ed-965d-4a8c-9445-964606df6563)
	- Even got a Nix install screen up ([Fission Discord](https://discord.com/channels/478735028319158273/1064261422390980678/1064261435191988386)), but then it hangs
	- Going to try an #Ubuntu install to see if that works
	- It does! But dumps into grub after selecting Ubuntu from the reFind boot loader
	- Looking at this [reFind and Grub details issue](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/425285/dual-boot-mac-with-ubuntu-boots-from-refind-into-grub-instead-of-ubuntu), booted back into MacOS and copied the drivers folder over
	- Now it crashes when selecting boot
	- I'm giving up on this quest, it is likely issues with the hard drive itself at this point
	- I have a 100GB ext4 partition on the Mac Mini
	- This might be accessible in running [[VirtualBox]] through [raw disk mode](http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch09.html#rawdisk)
	- Also been meaning to try out [[Multipass]] which appears to work alongside VirtualBox
	- Over on the Macbook Air with an M1 chip, [[UTM]] looks interesting

	- This looks like a good method. I think I can stand up a [[WriteFreely]] instance without having to self host plnetwork.xyz for starters
- I did some looking into [[Cepheus Engine]], an #[[open gaming]] #TTRPG
	- The [Cepheus Engine SRD](https://www.orffenspace.com/cepheus-srd/index.html) is all in HTML and available from GitHub, so I should be able to pour it into #LogSeq

That’s an excellent goal that eases a transition in the short-term, but ignores how a [new open standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/)(ActivityPub) can be leveraged in new and different ways.
