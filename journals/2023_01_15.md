	- via [[Mark Upton]] dropping the link into the #Fission Discord
- [Continuing](logseq://graph/bmcgardenlogseq?block-id=63c3c7ed-96e1-42d4-be6f-7bd8b0aa5d4e) from attempting either a #NixOS or #Ubuntu install on the #[[Mac Mini]]
	- Can't seem to get partition bootable
	- Finally got holding down option at boot working
	- [reFind](https://sourceforge.net/projects/refind/) is installed as per the [Make Use Of article](logseq://graph/bmcgardenlogseq?block-id=63c3c7ed-965d-4a8c-9445-964606df6563)
	- Even got a Nix install screen up ([Fission Discord](https://discord.com/channels/478735028319158273/1064261422390980678/1064261435191988386)), but then it hangs
	- Going to try an #Ubuntu install to see if that works
	- It does! But dumps into grub after selecting Ubuntu from the reFind boot loader
	- Looking at this [reFind and Grub details issue](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/425285/dual-boot-mac-with-ubuntu-boots-from-refind-into-grub-instead-of-ubuntu), booted back into MacOS and copied the drivers folder over
	- Now it crashes when selecting boot
	- I'm giving up on this quest, it is likely issues with the hard drive itself at this point
	- I have a 100GB ext4 partition on the Mac Mini
	- This might be accessible in running [[VirtualBox]] through [raw disk mode](http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch09.html#rawdisk)
	- Also been meaning to try out [[Multipass]] which appears to work alongside VirtualBox
	- Over on the Macbook Air with an M1 chip, [[UTM]] looks interesting
