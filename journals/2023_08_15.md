- [The OpenTF Manifesto](https://opentf.org/) is exactly what you think it is: an "Open Terraform", reacting to the [[Hashicorp]] #BSL licensing of #Terraform
	- > Terraform was open-sourced in 2014 under the Mozilla Public License (v2.0) (the “[[MPL]]”). Over the next ~9 years, it built up a community that included thousands of users, contributors, customers, certified practitioners, vendors, and an ecosystem of open-source modules, plugins, libraries, and extensions. Then, on August 10th, 2023, with little or no advance notice or chance for much, if not all, of the community to have any input, HashiCorp switched the license for Terraform from the MPL to the Business Source License (v1.1) (the “ [[BUSL]] ”), a non-open source license. In our opinion, this change threatens the entire community and ecosystem that’s built up around Terraform over the last 9 years.
	  > 
	  > **Our concern: the BUSL license is a poison pill for Terraform.**
	- It has a large number of co-signed companies and individuals, which also commit to things like "Cover the cost of 5 FTEs for at least 5 years"
	- TODO Retcon a link to the #Hashicorp BSL re-licensing, [not just this aside](((64d92cc8-e594-44b2-bbd8-4a9ed538c5a3)))
- I was asking about static site publishing and relative links in the [[Filecoin/Slack]] today
	- [[olizilla]] pointed me to his all relative library https://github.com/olizilla/all-relative
	- TODO figure out how to run [[all-relative]] as part of [[Github/Actions]] [[BMC/Backlog]]
