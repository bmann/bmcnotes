	- > Subconscious is [local-first software](https://www.wired.com/story/the-cloud-is-a-prison-can-the-local-first-software-movement-set-us-free/). Your data lives on your device, so you always have it with you. It’s also synced to [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/), a decentralized network. This means you have the multiplayer features of a cloud app, but you own your data, and have [credible exit](https://subconscious.substack.com/p/credible-exit) through your device, or any IPFS peer.
	- > Noosphere is open like email, or the web. Anyone can run a node, and developers can build new tools on top. But it also goes a step further, using [self-certifying cryptography](https://jaygraber.medium.com/web3-is-self-certifying-9dad77fd8d81) and [decentralized protocols](https://ipfs.tech/) to eliminate the need for any centralized authority. That means [you own your data forever](https://subconscious.substack.com/p/the-minimal-definition-of-user-agency). Noosphere is a knowledge commons for thinking freely with others.
