- [[Medium]] has [launched their own Mastodon instance](https://blog.medium.com/medium-embraces-mastodon-19dcb873eb11) #Mastodon
	- > Today, Medium is launching a Mastodon instance at [me.dm](https://me.dm/) to help our authors, publications and readers find a home in the fediverse. Mastodon is an emerging force for good in social media and we are excited to join this community.
	- [[Tony Stubblebine]] is the CEO and a great [follow on Mastodon](https://me.dm/@coachtony)
	- And round up of [Getting started on Mastodon](https://scottlamb.blog/list/getting-started-on-mastodon-f4843d1cc80f) posts on Medium
- [The era of Mastodon](https://blog.opencollective.com/the-era-of-mastodon/) by [[Open Collective]] #Mastodon
	- > Recently, the Open Collective CTO François Hodierne spotted an upsurge of activity in [Mastodon Collectives on the platform](https://opencollective.com/search?q=mastodon&sortBy=ACTIVITY). Many instances rely on crowdfunding to cover costs, and are seeking open source, community-oriented, transparent fundraising solutions that meet their needs.

- Turns out that [[Nolan Lawson]] is [Retiring Pinafore](https://nolanlawson.com/2023/01/09/retiring-pinafore/), a web-based client for #Mastodon #[[ActivityPub/Client]]
	- Why retire working on it?
	- Nolan has written [[What it feels like to be an open-source maintainer]] previously
	- #Svelte framework upgrades
		- > I suspect one of the reasons for this is that Pinafore is written in Svelte v2 and [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/) – both of which are deprecated in favor of Svelte v3 and [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/). Not only is there [no migration path](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/2462)from Svelte v2 to v3, but [there isn’t one](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/migrating) from Sapper to SvelteKit either. (And on top of that, I had to [fork Sapper](https://github.com/nolanlawson/sapper) pretty heavily.) Anyone making a bet on learning Pinafore’s tech stack is investing in a dead framework, so it’s not very attractive for new maintainers.
	- On the #ActivityPub client server API vs the #[[Mastodon/API]]
	- > First off, [ActivityPub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub) does have a [client-to-server API](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#client-to-server-interactions), but as far as I can tell, it’s not really worth implementing. Mastodon is the 800-pound gorilla in the fediverse, [it doesn’t implement](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/10520) this API, and other servers (such as [Pleroma](https://pleroma.social/) and [Misskey](https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey)) implement their own flavor of Mastodon’s API.
