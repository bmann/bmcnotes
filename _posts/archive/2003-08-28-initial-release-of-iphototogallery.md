- Zach Wily has come out of hiding and and publicly released <a href="http://zwily.com/iphoto/">iPhotoToGallery 0.2 Beta</a>.
- The plugin for iPhoto adds a tab to the export screen that allows you to upload your pictures from iPhoto directly into Gallery.
- I've been beta testing it, and have had exactly zero problems with it. Note to Zach: make the front/news page an RSS feed! Also: nice screenshot of the Panther version of iPhoto...
